{"name":"Feed-on-feeds","tagline":"RSS feed aggregator","body":"# About\r\n\r\nFeedOnFeeds is a lightweight server-based RSS aggregator and reader,\r\nallowing you to keep up with syndicated content (blogs, comics, and so\r\nforth) without having to keep track of what you've read. Being\r\nserver-based means all of your feeds and history are kept in one\r\nplace, and being lightweight means you can install it pretty much\r\nanywhere without needing a fancy dedicated server or the like.\r\n\r\nFeedOnFeeds was originally written by Steve Minutillo; this fork\r\nstrives to stay up-to-date with changes to PHP while improving\r\nsecurity, multiuser support, and overall design.\r\n\r\n#Requirements\r\n\r\nFeedOnFeeds requires:\r\n\r\n* A web server running PHP\r\n* Access to a PDO-capable database (MySQL and SQLite are currently supported,\r\n  and more are easy to add)\r\n* Specific features may require specific PHP extensions; it is highly\r\n  recommended (but not required) that you have Xlib, cURL, and iconv.\r\n\r\n#Installation\r\n\r\nTo install, simply download a snapshot or clone from your favorite git\r\nrepository.  Then copy fof-config.php.dist to fof-config.php and edit\r\nit as appropriate for your setup. If you're on shared hosting, be sure\r\nto point `FOF_DATA_PATH` to somewhere in your home directory.\r\n\r\nAfter that, point a web browser to install.php; For example, if you've\r\ninstalled it at http://example.com/fof, go to\r\nhttp://example.com/fof/install.php and then everything should be set\r\nup automatically.\r\n\r\n# FAQ/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n#### Which database backend should I use?\r\n\r\nMost of the time, SQLite is what you want. You should only consider MySQL if\r\nyou're going to support many concurrent users (i.e. 10 or more people using the\r\napp simultaneously), as SQLite has much lower administrative overhead and makes\r\nit easier to port your data to a new webhost. This is the case even if you\r\nalready havea working MySQL installation, and using SQLite will not interfere\r\nwith your existing MySQL in any way.\r\n\r\n#### I'm having an error message at installation:\r\n\r\n##### I'm getting `couldn't open logfile /path/to/fof-data/fof-install.log`\r\n\r\nYou need to set the value of `FOF_DATA_PATH` in fof-config.php\r\n\r\n##### I'm getting `Syntax error or access violation` after \"Cannot upgrade table: `[CREATE TRIGGER ...`\r\n\r\nThis occurs if you're on MySQL shared hosting and you don't have access to\r\ntrigger creation, which is fairly common.  Find the following in\r\n`fof-config.php`:\r\n\r\n    // define('SQL_NO_TRIGGERS', 1);\r\n\r\nand remove the `//` at the beginning of the line.\r\n\r\n#### How do I delete a feed?\r\n\r\nIn the feeds list there's a little triangle (that looks like &Delta;). Hover\r\nover it and enjoy the context menu.\r\n\r\nIf you've set the UI theme to \"simple,\" just click on the \"d\" in the feeds\r\nlist.\r\n\r\n# Upgrading\r\n\r\nUpgrading to a newer FeedOnFeeds usually just involves downloading a\r\nnew snapshot or issuing a git pull, and then pointing a browser at install.php\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n# Setting up automatic updates\r\n\r\nFeedOnFeeds works best if you have it set to automatically update your feeds\r\non-the-fly. The best way to do this is to set up a cron job like\r\nso:\r\n\r\n     * * * * * curl http://example.com/fof/update-quiet.php\r\n\r\nDon't worry about updates occurring too frequently - FeedOnFeeds will only\r\nupdate feeds which are due for an update. By default it will\r\nupdate every feed at most once an hour, but if you enable dynamic\r\nupdate intervals in the admin preferences, it will adjust the polling\r\nupdate for feeds based on their historical update frequencies.\r\n\r\nIf you're on Dreamhost, you can set up your cron job from the \"goodies\" section\r\nof the panel, and create a new cron job with the following:\r\n\r\n* Command to run: `curl http://path/to/fof/update-quiet.php` (setting the URL\r\n  appropriately)\r\n* When to run: Custom\r\n* Minutes: Every 10 minutes\r\n* Hours: Every Hour\r\n* Day of month: Every Day\r\n* Month: Every Month\r\n* Day of Week: Every Day of Week\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Legal\r\n\r\nFeedOnFeeds is distributed under the GPL.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
